## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using San Francisco Airbnb data from 2021 to better understand:

1. What features are the most predictive of price?
2. What amenities are the most valuable?
3. How do accommodation sizes, housing types, and location affect price?

I have included the San Francisco listings dataset from Airbnb, and you can see the full analysis in the Jupyter Notebook file, "SF_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb".


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook follows the CRISP-DM Data Science Process. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps. The Airbnb listings dataset for San Francisco as of December, 2021 is also included.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@andrew.wrist/how-do-you-become-a-successful-airbnb-host-in-san-francisco-a21ae0e796be).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
